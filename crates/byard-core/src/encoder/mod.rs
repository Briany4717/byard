//! # Encoder
//!
//! Multi-pipeline `wgpu` command dispatch.
//!
//! This subsystem owns the specialised render pipelines compiled at startup:
//!
//! - **`SolidBox`** — Axis-aligned rectangles with solid fill **and per-corner
//!   `border-radius` via an analytical SDF**. This absorbs the basic rounded-rect
//!   case from the RFC §3.1 `DecoratedBox` column by design: a single instanced
//!   pipeline handles both plain and rounded rectangles with zero extra GPU state
//!   switches, because the radius parameters are part of the per-instance vertex
//!   data rather than a pipeline variant.
//! - **`DecoratedBox`** — Rectangles with gradients, box-shadows, and parametric
//!   decorations (future sub-issue).
//! - **`TextGlyph`** — Text rendering via a `glyphon` glyph atlas (future).
//! - **`TextureSampler`** — UV-mapped quads for decoded images and icons (future).
//!
//! Primitives are batched into Z-bins (stacking contexts) and ordered first by
//! pipeline, then by local Z-index, to minimise GPU context switches.
//!
//! Pipeline creation is wrapped in `Device::push_error_scope` (returns an
//! `ErrorScopeGuard` in wgpu 28+) and `scope.pop().await` with
//! `ErrorFilter::Validation`. Failures are surfaced as
//! [`ByardError::PipelineCompilation`](crate::ByardError::PipelineCompilation)
//! — the engine never panics on a GPU error.

    /// that, unlike the swapchain image, is guaranteed to retain its
    /// contents across frames. See that field's doc comment for why this

    /// Three cases, decided by [`needs_full_redraw_this_frame`]:

    ///   and every `TextLine` unscissored — identical to this function's
    ///   pre-#31 behaviour.
    /// - **Incremental** (not a full redraw, and at least one `TextLine` is
    ///   dirty): the inner pass loads (does not clear) `persistent_color`,
    ///   restricts fragment writes to `wgpu::RenderPass::set_scissor_rect`
    ///   for the union of the dirty lines' *current and previous* bounding
    ///   boxes (see [`dirty_text_bounds`]), then draws a fully transparent
    ///   "clear quad" over exactly that rect via [`clear_pipeline`](
    ///   Self::clear_pipeline) before redrawing — standard alpha blending
    ///   alone cannot erase stale content (see that field's doc comment),
    ///   so this step is required, not optional. Every `BoxInstance` is
    ///   then redrawn too (the clear quad may have wiped one), bounded by
    ///   the active scissor rect. `TextGlyphPipeline::prepare`/`render`
    ///   still receive the **full, unfiltered** `texts` slice; see the note
    ///   above the `render` call below for why.
    /// - **Nothing dirty**: the inner pass is skipped entirely — zero GPU
    ///   work beyond the mandatory composite step below.
    ///
    /// In every case, the frame ends with an unscissored
    /// `copy_texture_to_texture` of `persistent_color`'s current contents
    /// onto `target` (the swapchain image), since the swapchain's own
    /// previous contents are never assumed valid.
