//! # Encoder
//!
//! Multi-pipeline `wgpu` command dispatch.
//!
//! This subsystem owns the specialised render pipelines compiled at startup:
//!
//! - **`SolidBox`** — Axis-aligned rectangles with solid fill **and per-corner
//!   `border-radius` via an analytical SDF**. This absorbs the basic rounded-rect
//!   case from the RFC §3.1 `DecoratedBox` column by design: a single instanced
//!   pipeline handles both plain and rounded rectangles with zero extra GPU state
//!   switches, because the radius parameters are part of the per-instance vertex
//!   data rather than a pipeline variant.
//! - **`DecoratedBox`** — Rectangles with gradients, box-shadows, and parametric
//!   decorations (future sub-issue).
//! - **`TextGlyph`** — Text rendering via a `glyphon` glyph atlas (future).
//! - **`TextureSampler`** — UV-mapped quads for decoded images and icons (future).
//!
//! Primitives are batched into Z-bins (stacking contexts) and ordered first by
//! pipeline, then by local Z-index, to minimise GPU context switches.
//!
//! Pipeline creation is wrapped in `Device::push_error_scope` (returns an
//! `ErrorScopeGuard` in wgpu 28+) and `scope.pop().await` with
//! `ErrorFilter::Validation`. Failures are surfaced as
//! [`ByardError::PipelineCompilation`](crate::ByardError::PipelineCompilation)
//! — the engine never panics on a GPU error.
