//! # Engine
//!
//! Top-level orchestrator that binds the Relay, Encoder, and `wgpu` surface.
//!
//! [`Engine`] is the public entry point for platform code. The platform
//! creates one `Engine` per window, calls [`Engine::start_logic`] once to
//! spawn the logic thread, notifies it of resize events via
//! [`Engine::on_resize`], and drives it frame-by-frame via
//! [`Engine::render_latest`]. The engine never imports windowing primitives
//! (`winit`, `raw-window-handle`, etc.) — surface creation and window
//! lifecycle are entirely the platform's responsibility (RFC-0001 §6).
//!
//! ## Coordinate system
//!
//! All instance coordinates (rect, radii, etc.) and the viewport uniform are
//! in **logical pixels** — the same density-independent unit used by CSS,
//! `SwiftUI` points, and Android dp. On `HiDPI` displays (Retina 2×, etc.) the
//! platform must supply the OS-reported `scale_factor` so that the engine can
//! internally convert physical pixels → logical pixels for the viewport
//! uniform, while keeping the `wgpu` surface in physical pixels as required
//! by the API.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model (RFC-0001 §5)
//!
//! ```text
//!   Platform (winit / etc.)                    byard-core
