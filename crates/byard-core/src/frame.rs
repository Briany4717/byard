//! Shared data types for cross-subsystem communication.
//!
//! This module defines [`RenderFrame`] and [`TargetId`], the primitive types
//! that flow between the evaluator, atlas, encoder, and relay subsystems.
//! It is the **only** module that all subsystems may depend on.
//!
//! ```text
//! encoder  ──┐
//! atlas    ──┤─→  frame  ←─  relay
//! evaluator ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! Adding a dependency from one subsystem to another (e.g. `encoder` importing
//! from `evaluator`) is a design defect. If data needs to cross that boundary,
//! it must be modelled as a type in this module.
