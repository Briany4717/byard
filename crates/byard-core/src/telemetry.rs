//! Zero-allocation telemetry & profiling (RFC-0013).
//!
//! Each engine thread owns a fixed-capacity, thread-local ring of
//! [`Sample`]s. [`profile_scope!`] wraps a block in an RAII [`Guard`] that
//! writes one sample on drop; the ring never grows and never allocates on
//! the hot path (P1). At end-of-tick, [`crate::relay::Relay::publish`] calls
//! [`crate::frame::RenderFrame::drain_telemetry`], which pulls the calling
//! thread's ring into the frame's own [`SampleBlock`], piggybacking on the
//! existing atomic frame swap instead of opening a new channel.
//!
//! With the `telemetry` Cargo feature off, [`profile_scope!`] expands to a
//! no-op statement — zero cost in a build that disables it (e.g. release).
